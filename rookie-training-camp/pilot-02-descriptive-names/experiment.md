# **Giving Descriptive Names**

## When you work on a project, there might come a time when you might want to name your folders, files etc. When doing so, there are a couple things you need to be aware of.

# **Experiment**

1. ### When you give names, make sure that you give a descriptive name that captures what you're trying to make everyone understand. For instance, naming your master project folder "master-project-folder" is much better than naming it "dragon-fist". The reason is, because everyone needs to understand what you're trying to do _**right away**_. They shouldn't waste time trying to understand what's on your mind. If you're naming some random folder on your hard drive, it's okay to use any name. But if you're working on a project with a lot of developers involved, it's advisable that you _**opt**_ for a descriptive name that makes everyone recall the name easily. 

2. ### Some projects might have a **naming conventions** section that tells you how you should name something in the project. If there ever was a naming convention in a project that you're working on, make sure you follow the guidelines given in it.
