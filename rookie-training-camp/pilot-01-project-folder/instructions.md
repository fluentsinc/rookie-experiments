# **Creating Master Project Folder**

## As a rookie, it might not occur to you that you would create and contribute to a lot of different software projects. This demands a solid organizational skill that can _**make your life easier**_ as you focus on perfecting your software skill.


# **Instructions**

1. ### Create a master project folder somewhere in your local computer's hard drive. This is the folder that you would use to store all the other projects. Give the folder any name of your choice but you should easily remember that that's your master project folder. 

2. ### The master project folder will contain all the projects you would work on. So if you need to create a backup for all your projects, you can simply backup the master project folder and be done with it.
