# **Naming Conventions**

## Naming conventions are a set of rules that defines how you should name things in your project. Major organizations such as Google, Microsoft or Apple usually have a naming conventions section that tells how everyone involved in the project should name different things. This pilot will try to lay out general naming conventions adopted by software developers regardless of which organization they might work for. 


# **Guidelines**

1. ### When naming something in multiple words, always use a hyphen. For instance, you should name `redstone-drift`, not `redstone drift`. Though you could also use an underscore like: `redstone_drift`, it's recommended not to do so because it's slower to type compared to hyphen as you need to hold a shift key down and there are bugs in some code editors that makes an underscore(`redstone_drift) look like it's been separated by a space(`redstone drift`) 

2. ### When you name something, always use lowercase letters. For example, it's advised that you use lowercase letters `redshift-nova` as opposed to `Redshift-Nova`.
