# **Rookie Experiments**

## This readme section will help you _**get the most out**_ of rookie experiments. 


## **Instructions** 

1. ### Go to the organization's teams page here: https://github.com/orgs/fluentsinc/teams and find "rookie-experiments". Follow the pilots assigned to you each day. Be active with the experiments. You gotta be able to get into the habit of being active. You wanna try each of the experiments just to _**get a feel for**_ them. Try them all out multiple times. 

2. ### Important terminologies are in **bold**. 

3. ### Informal descriptions are in (braces) right after the word that's getting described about. For example, sun(a star in the milky way galaxy).

4. ### If any part of the pilots use words, phrasal verbs or idioms that seems like advanced English to you, I want you to google it yourselves. To highlight such phrases or words, I will use _**an italic and a bold**_. Sometimes if I felt that giving an informal description like in Instruction #3 takes more space, I will use _**an italic and a bold**_. So if you see this type of font style and the words or phrases don't make sense to you, use google. 

5. ### Have better attention to detail. If something doesn't make sense to you the first time, feel free to review it the second time.
