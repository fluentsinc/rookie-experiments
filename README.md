# **Rookie Experiments**

## This readme section will help you _**get the most out**_ of rookie experiments. 


## **Guidelines** 

1. ### Go to the organization's teams page here: https://github.com/orgs/fluentsinc/teams and find "rookie-training-space". Follow the pilots assigned to you each day. Be active with the experiments. You gotta be able to get into the habit of being active. You wanna try each of the experiments just to _**get a feel for**_ them. Try them all out multiple times. 

2. ### Important terminologies are in **bold**. 

3. ### Informal descriptions are in (braces) right after the word that's getting described about. For example, sun(a star in the milky way galaxy).

4. ### If any part of the pilots uses words, phrasal verbs or idioms that seems advanced English to you, I want you to google it yourselves. To highlight such phrases or words, I will use _**an italic and a bold**_. Sometimes if I felt that giving an informal description like in Guidelines-#3 takes more space, I will use _**an italic and a bold**_. So if you see this type of font style and the words or phrases don't make sense to you, use google. Make sure you know what the words or phrases mean before you proceed going through the rest of the pilot. Because doing so can ensure that you understand the content thoroughly instead of assuming all the way through. We can either dumb down the whole team by using elementary words or we can lift the whole team up to a higher level. We chose to take the latter route. 

5. ### Have better attention to detail. If something doesn't make sense to you the first time, feel free to review it the second time but _**go through**_ the experiments more slowly and thoroughly this time from the start. If it still doesn't make sense to you, feel free to review it the third time but this time make sure you're following the pilots in the order that they've been assigned to you because the order matters, make sure that you're reading the entire pilot from the start again and go through very slowly and thoroughly than before. If it still doesn't make sense after all this, try Guidelines-#7 on how to pose a good question. 

6. ### If we reference an experiment number like `experiment-#4` in a pilot then you need to refer experiment #4 in the same pilot. But if we reference an experiment number like `git/pilot-02/experiment-#2` then you need to refer experiment #2 from pilot-02 of Git folder.

7. ### Because of the experiment-based approach to learning that we've adapted which stresses the motto "less dependence on others, more doing great things", there could be an _**hesitation**_ regarding whether asking questions might be _**looked down upon**_. With everything in life, we need constant feedback to improve things and make something better. Questions are one of the useful types of feedbacks available. But there are good questions and bad questions. In a professional environment, bad questions are generally met with _**contempt**_ and _**derision**_ because it takes precious time away from the team which could be better used doing something more productive. Bad questions have a few things in common: **lacks attention to detail**(creating a file when the pilot says "create a folder"), **sloppy with the content**(reading a part of the pilot instead of the entire pilot thus leading to questions in later pilots because you've missed an important point in the pilot that you've sloppily skipped), **didn't do the assignment thoroughly**(questions that arise because the player didn't actively do the experiments which leads to poor mastery of the concepts which ultimately affects learning later pilots). Good questions create improvements. Improvements like **better clarity in the content**(if the question leads to better rephrasing of the concepts), **less ambiguity**(reducing instances where we unintentionally use ambiguous language. For instance, refering "this" folder or "that" folder instead of clearly saying "scripts" or "projects" folder)
