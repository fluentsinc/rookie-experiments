# **Basics**

## Software developers write source code (dot files like .js, .net, .java). That's what they do. Sometimes all day every day. They need to have the right tools to help them do what they do. One of the fundamental tools they would use is the **source code editor**. As the name suggests, a **source code editor** helps you edit source code. There are a lot of source code editors out there that you might like and it's definitely up to you to use your preferred source code editor. But we recommend using Visual Studio Code because of its simplicity and ease of use. 

# **Experiment**

2. ### Open up Visual Code. The first time you open up you should get a window like the one you see below. Hover your mouse pointer arrow over the sidebar to see happens when you click on those icons.
