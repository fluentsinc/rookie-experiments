# **Create Git Repository**

## So far you've been using Git repositories created by someone else stored on a Git-hosting website like Github. You can create your own Git repositories too on your own computer. 

# **Experiment**

### 1. Create a new folder and name it accordingly. Git repositories are just normal folders that have memory about what files you put into the folder and when you put files into the folder. So to create a Git repository, the first step is to create a folder. Everything you put inside the folder is recorded by Git if you tell it to keep in memory.

### 2. You don't need to create a workspace to create a Git repository, we are creating a workspace here so as to make things easier for us because we might eventually want to create a workspace for convenience. So create a workspace adding the folder you've created above. 

### Close Visual Code. Reopen the workspace you've created above in Visual Code again. Type this command in the integrated terminal: `git init` This command creates the Git repository.
