# **Pull Git Repository Changes**

## Hopefully by the time you're reading this, you have several Git repositories cloned to your computer and each of the repositories has been assigned a workspace with an appropriate name. When you clone a repository, you download the files in the repository at that point in time. If the repository had three pilots when you had cloned, you would've downloaded three pilots. What if someone added a fourth pilot and you want to just download the fourth pilot, not the first three pilots because you already have them? You **pull** from the Git repositories for these scenarios. 

# **Experiment**

1. ### To perform a Git pull, open up a workspace file of your choice in Visual Code from the workspaces folder inside your master project folder.

2. ### Open up the integrated terminal. Execute this command: `git pull`. Doing so downloads all the updated files. 

3. ### This is the way you should download new pilots that are added to the repository you're working on. For instance, if you are assigned to the `rookie-experiments` repository and the team assigns a pilot not on your workspace. You need to perform a Git pull to download the pilots that you've been assigned.   

4. ### So as mentioned above, as you do your assigned pilots everyday, you need to always perform `git pull` on `rookie-experiments` workspace so that you're up to date with the rest of the team.
