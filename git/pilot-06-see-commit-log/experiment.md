# **See Commit Log**

## In this pilot, you learn how to see the commit log. Commit logs lets you see you all the commits you've created in a particular Git repository. 

# **Experiment**

### 1. Open the workspace you've used to create the Git repository and the commits as in `git/pilot-04` and `git/pilot-05`. 

### 2. Type this command in the integrated terminal to see the commit log: `git log`
